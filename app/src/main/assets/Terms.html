        <p>
        The Application is licensed, not sold, to You by Staples, Inc. ("Staples"). Your license to the Application is subject to Your prior acceptance of this
        Agreement, and You agree that the terms of this Agreement will apply to each Product that You license through the Application. Your license to any Third

        (except as, and only to the extent, any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may be permitted by the licensing terms
        governing use of any open sourced components included with the Application). Any attempt to do so is a violation of the rights of Staples and its
        licensors. If You breach this restriction, You may be subject to prosecution and damages.
        </p>
        <p>
        The terms of this Agreement will govern any upgrades provided by Staples that replace and/or supplement the original Application, unless such upgrade is
        accompanied by a separate license in which case the terms of that license will govern.
        </p>
        <p>
        You acknowledge and agree that Apple and Apple's subsidiaries are third party beneficiaries of this Agreement and that, upon Your acceptance of the terms

        Here are some additional things that You can do to protect yourself from identity theft if You think that Your Personal Information has been compromised:
        </p>
        <p>
        Review Your Account Statements - Carefully review Your bank, credit card, and other account statements every month to ensure that all of Your account
        activity is valid. Report any questionable charges promptly and in writing to the card or account issuer.
        </p>
        <p>
        Check Your Credit Report - Check Your credit report periodically to ensure that all Your information is correct. You can obtain a free credit report once
        per year by visiting www.annualcreditreport.com or by calling 877-322-8228. Carefully reviewing Your credit report can help You spot problems and address
        them quickly. If You have any questions about Your credit report or notice any inaccuracies, contact the relevant consumer reporting agency promptly at the
        telephone number listed on the report.
        </p>
        <p>
        Fraud Alert - Consider placing a fraud alert on Your credit file. The fraud alert requests that creditors contact You before opening any new accounts or
        increasing credit limits on Your existing accounts. You can place a fraud alert on Your credit file by contacting one of three consumer reporting agencies
        listed below. You need to contact only one of the three agencies; the one You contact is required by law to contact the other two. You will receive
        confirmation letters in the mail and then will be able to order a credit report from each of the three agencies, free of charge. The fraud alert will
        remain in Your credit file for at least 90 days.
